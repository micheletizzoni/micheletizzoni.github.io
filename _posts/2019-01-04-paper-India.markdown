According to the World Health Organization, close to 800,000 people die by suicide every year, with 78% of global suicides occurring in low- and middle-income countries.
Among them, India is home to 20% of the worldâ€™s suicide deaths.
In the paper [How Search Engine Data Enhance the Understanding of Determinants of Suicide in India and Inform Prevention: Observational Study](https://www.jmir.org/2019/1/e10179/), we combined official statistics on demographic information with data generated through search queries from Bing to gain insight into suicide rates per state in India as reported by the National Crimes Record Bureau.

This work, recently published by JMIR, is the outcome of a [data collaborative](https://datacollaboratives.org) involving the [ISI Foundation](https://www.isi.it), [UNICEF](https://unicef.org), [the GovLab](https://thegovlab.org) and [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research).
