JMIR Public Health and Surveillance has recently published the manuscript [Combining Participatory Influenza Surveillance with Modeling and Forecasting: Three Alternative Approaches](http://publichealth.jmir.org/2017/4/e83/), which is the result of a large collaboration between three teams of mathematical modelers across Italy, the UK and the US.
The paper is part of a [thematic issue on Participatory Disease Surveillance](http://publichealth.jmir.org/themes/495).

In this study, we describe three different participatory surveillance systems, WISDM (Widely Internet Sourced Distributed Monitoring), Influenzanet and Flu Near You (FNY), and show how modeling and simulation can be or has been combined with participatory disease surveillance to: i) measure the non-response bias in a participatory surveillance sample using WISDM; and ii) nowcast and forecast influenza activity in different parts of the world (using Influenzanet and Flu Near You).
