I will be in Tempe, AZ, to attend the [Conference of Complex Systems 2015](http://ccs2015.org) from September 28 to October 2, and present two talks:
<ol>
<li>"The scaling of human contacts and epidemic processes in metapopulation networks"</li>
<li>"Quantifying social contacts in a household setting of rural Kenya using wearable proximity sensors" in the satellite meeting <a href="http://contagion15.weebly.com/">Contagion</a></li>
</ol>
