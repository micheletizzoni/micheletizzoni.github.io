The paper [Assessing the use of mobile phone data to describe recurrent mobility patterns in spatial epidemic models](http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/4/5/160950), which I co-authored with Cecilia Panigutti, Paolo Bajardi, Zbigniew Smoreda and Vittoria Colizza, has been published by the Royal Society Open Science.

In this study, we extensively tested with numerical simulations to what degree epidemic models based on mobile phone data can match results based on census data.
We found that similarity of simulated epidemics is significantly correlated to connectivity, traffic and population size of the seeding nodes, suggesting that the adequacy of mobile phone data for infectious disease models becomes higher when epidemics spread between highly connected and heavily populated locations, such as large urban areas.
