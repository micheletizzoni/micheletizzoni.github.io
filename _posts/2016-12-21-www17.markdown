Two papers which I have co-authored have been accepted to [WWW'17 the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web](http://www.www17.com.au), that will take place in Perth, Australia, on April 3-7 2017.
Both papers have been accepted in the newly introduced [Computational Health track](http://www2017.com.au/call-for-papers/computational-health.php).
