My research interests revolve around the general field of <strong>infectious disease epidemiology</strong> with a special focus on <strong>mathematical modeling</strong> and the application of interdisciplinary methods, such as <strong>network theory</strong>, to the field.

<h4>Pandemic forecasting</h4>
During my PhD studies, I worked as a member of the [GLEAM](http://www.gleamviz.org) (Global Epidemic and Mobility Model) Research Team. In particular, during the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic crisis I joined the team in the effort of predicting the pandemic spread at the global scale through numerical simulations. Eventually, my main contribution has allowed to [validate the real-time forecasts made during the early phase of the pandemic](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/10/165), using surveillance data collected for 1 year in more than 50 countries of the world.

<h4>Host heterogeneities and spatial epidemic spreading</h4>
On a more theoretical side, I am interested in studying epidemic processes occurring between hosts that are characterized by heterogeneities, in terms of mobility patterns and individual interactions. We integrate these real-world features into mathematical and computational epidemic models, and analyze their effects through numerical simulations and analytical calculations. In particular, my recent work has focused on the [epidemiological consequences of large fluctuations in the time spent at destination](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep00476?WT.ec_id=SREP-631-20120702) by travelers, and the [scaling properties of contacts in urban areas](http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7310).

<h4>Digital Epidemiology</h4>
From a broader perspective, I am interested in the application of new technologies to the field of epidemiology and public health. I recently worked on the [use of mobile phone data to inform epidemic models](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003716) and I am involved in the [SocioPatterns project](http://sociopatterns.org) whose aim is to collect empirical data on human interactions by proximity sensing devices.
