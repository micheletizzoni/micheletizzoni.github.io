I am currently a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the Department of Sociology and Social Research of the [University of Trento](https://www.sociologia.unitn.it/en). 

Until 2022, I was a Senior Researcher at the [Institute for Scientific Interchange (ISI) Foundation](http://www.isi.it) in the [Data Science for Social Impact and Sustainability](https://www.isi.it/en/research/data-science-for-social-impact-and-sustainability) research area. 
I studied Theoretical Physics at the [University of Torino](http://unito.it), where I completed my Mastersâ€™ Degree in 2007. The following year I entered the Ph.D. program in Physics of the [Politecnico of Torino](http://www.polito.it).
In 2009, I joined the Computational Epidemiology Laboratory at the ISI Foundation where I completed my graduate studies under the supervision of [Vittoria Colizza](http://www.epicx-lab.com).
In 2010, I was Visiting Research Scholar at the [Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research of Indiana University](http://cnets.indiana.edu/), Bloomington, IN, USA. After defending my Ph.D. dissertation, I held a joint appointment between the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control, in Vancouver, BC, Canada, and the ISI Foundation as a post-doctoral research fellow for one year.
