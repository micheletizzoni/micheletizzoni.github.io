I am currently Principal Researcher at the [Institute for Scientific Interchange (ISI) Foundation](http://www.isi.it).

I studied Physics at the University of Torino, Italy, where I completed my Mastersâ€™ Degree in 2007 with a thesis in statistical physics about "Nucleation in the three dimensional Ising model". The following year I entered the PhD program in Physics of the Politecnico of Torino. In 2009, I joined the Computational Epidemiology Laboratory at the ISI Foundation in Torino, where I completed my PhD studies under the supervision of [Vittoria Colizza](http://www.epicx-lab.com).

Between September and December 2010, I was Visting Research Scholar at the [Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research of Indiana University](http://cnets.indiana.edu/), Bloomington, IN, USA.

In Februray 2012 I successfully defended my PhD dissertation titled "Modelling human mobility and the large-scale spatial spread of infectious diseases". From April 2012 until March 2013 I held a joint appointment between the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control, in Vancouver, BC, Canada, and the ISI Foundation as a post-doctoral research fellow.
